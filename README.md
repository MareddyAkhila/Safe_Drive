## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **real-time fatigue detection system** to enhance safety, particularly in high-risk environments like driving or industrial operations. By integrating **physiological**, **visual**, and **behavioral** data, and applying machine learning and deep learning techniques, the system aims to detect early signs of fatigue and trigger timely alerts — potentially saving lives.
